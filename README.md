# 🚀 Future Wallet: High-Fidelity Financial Projection Engine

**Future Wallet** is a state-of-the-art financial simulation platform built for high-fidelity personal wealth projection. It combines a sophisticated **DAG-based dependency engine** with a premium, **Glassmorphism-styled dashboard** to provide a deep, interactive look into your financial future.

## ✨ key Features

### 🧠 Core Simulation Engine
- **Dynamic DAG Infrastructure:** Model complex financial relationships (Income → Tax → Savings) using a Directed Acyclic Graph.
- **Monte Carlo Scenarios:** Run deterministic simulations across "Optimistic", "Base Case", and "Pessimistic" trajectories.
- **Shock Modeling:** Simulate random financial crises with rolling recovery slopes and SCD (Shock Clustering Density).

### 💱 Multi-Currency & Exchange Dynamics
- **Correlated GBM Dynamics:** Currency rates evolve using Geometric Brownian Motion with mean-reversion.
- **Multi-Wallet Ledger:** Track balances in USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, and more with high-precision arithmetic.
- **Precision Auditing:** Dedicated reports on floating-point drift during high-frequency conversions.

### 🏦 Credit & Taxation Subsystems
- **Credit Score Evolution:** Dynamic scoring based on debt-to-income, punctuality, and restructuring events.
- **Progressive Taxation:** Accurate modeling of income tax, capital gains (ST/LT), and FX-realized gains.

### 🎨 Premium UI/UX
- **Glassmorphism Design:** Modern, frosted-glass aesthetics with `backdrop-filter` effects.
- **Animated Dashboard:** Interactive Plotly gauges, responsive treemaps, and shimmering hero sections.
- **Recursive Pet State:** A "Financial Vibe" companion that reacts (pulse, shake, bounce) to your simulation's health.

## 🔮 What-If Analysis
Future Wallet supports **Phase-Space Branching**. Snapshot your current simulation at any day and run divergent "what-if" timelines (e.g., "What if I get a raise at year 3?") to see exactly how small changes impact your 5-year wealth trajectory.
